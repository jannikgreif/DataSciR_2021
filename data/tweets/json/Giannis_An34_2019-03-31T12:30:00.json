With the move to FS1 also comes a move back to the West Coast for the Washington-born Cowherd, who hosts the show in Los Angeles after being based in Connecticut with his previous employer."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10029304530","name":"NBA Basketball"}},{"domain":{"id":"4","name":"TV Episodes","description":"Television show episodes"},"entity":{"id":"10055946006","name":"The Herd with Colin Cowherd"}},{"domain":{"id":"11","name":"Sport","description":"Types of sports, like soccer and basketball"},"entity":{"id":"706083902411055104","name":"Basketball"}},{"domain":{"id":"26","name":"Sports League","description":""},"entity":{"id":"706083889454813185","name":"NBA"}},{"domain":{"id":"45","name":"Brand Vertical","description":"Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"},"entity":{"id":"781974597310615553","name":"Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"46","name":"Brand Category","description":"Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"},"entity":{"id":"781974597105094656","name":"TV/Movies Related"}},{"domain":{"id":"46","name":"Brand Category","description":"Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"},"entity":{"id":"781974597491040257","name":"Sports"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"10041116731","name":"ESPN"}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"890946046343303177","name":"Colin Cowherd","description":"Colin Cowherd"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"92","name":"Sports Personality","description":"A Sports Personality like 'Skip Bayless'"},"entity":{"id":"890946046343303177","name":"Colin Cowherd","description":"Colin Cowherd"}}],"id":"1111720268861456388","created_at":"2019-03-29T20:02:21.000Z","source":"Twitter for iPhone","conversation_id":"1111708897662943233","author_id":"437564237","in_reply_to_user_id":"2557521","referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1111708897662943233"}],"geo":{},"attachments":{"media_keys":{},"poll_ids":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-31 12:30:00","GameId":"201903310ATL"},{"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":7,"username":"JJWatt"},{"start":8,"end":21,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":{},"urls":{},"hashtags":{}},"text":"@JJWatt @Giannis_An34 Class act","lang":"en","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":4,"quote_count":0},"possibly_sensitive":false,"context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809518103348424704","name":"J.J.
