Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men - playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"2279776304","created_at":"2019-03-09T19:47:21.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"979428166258348032","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104185929659486211"}],"id":"1104468409797017608","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":13,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":[{"start":38,"end":41,"probability":0.6082,"type":"Product","normalized_text":"Hulu"},{"start":62,"end":64,"probability":0.3989,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"hbo"}],"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for iPhone","conversation_id":"1104185929659486211","lang":"en","text":"@Giannis_An34 Dm me and I’ll share my Hulu account I have the hbo upgrade","context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"45","name":"Brand Vertical","description":"Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"},"entity":{"id":"781974597310615553","name":"Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"46","name":"Brand Category","description":"Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"},"entity":{"id":"781974597105094656","name":"TV/Movies Related"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"10026371049","name":"Hulu"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"10037586459","name":"HBO"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"2279776304","created_at":"2019-03-09T19:46:03.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"381013176","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104189305457700864"}],"id":"1104468375164645377","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":4,"username":"HBO"},{"start":5,"end":18,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for Android","conversation_id":"1104185929659486211","lang":"en","text":"@HBO @Giannis_An34 When the weed man hear you asking who good...","context_annotations":[{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"45","name":"Brand Vertical","description":"Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"},"entity":{"id":"781974597310615553","name":"Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"46","name":"Brand Category","description":"Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"},"entity":{"id":"781974597105094656","name":"TV/Movies Related"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"10037586459","name":"HBO"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"15635604","created_at":"2019-03-09T19:45:55.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"106605039","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104185929659486211"}],"id":"1104467639903178752","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":13,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for Android","conversation_id":"1104185929659486211","lang":"en","text":"@Giannis_An34 You can come to my house.

Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men - playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"2279776304","created_at":"2019-03-09T12:59:08.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"32415387","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":1,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104185929659486211"}],"id":"1104365524492922881","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":13,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":[{"start":21,"end":31,"probability":0.568,"type":"Place","normalized_text":"Oval Office"}],"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for iPad","conversation_id":"1104185929659486211","lang":"en","text":"@Giannis_An34 In the Oval Office.

Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men - playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people

Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"2279776304","created_at":"2019-03-09T01:04:30.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"50696943","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":0,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104185929659486211"}],"id":"1104186160761458688","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":13,"username":"Giannis_An34"},{"start":28,"end":41,"username":"thatnegus_sb"}],"annotations":{},"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for Android","conversation_id":"1104185929659486211","lang":"en","text":"@Giannis_An34 Hang out with @thatnegus_sb.

He also welcomes athletes, analysts, beat writers and other guests to share their thoughts on the hot topics of the day. With the move to FS1 also comes a move back to the West Coast for the Washington-born Cowherd, who hosts the show in Los Angeles after being based in Connecticut with his previous employer."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10029190505","name":"Live: NBA Basketball","description":"Live coverage from the National Basketball Association, the top basketball league in North America."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10029304530","name":"NBA Basketball"}},{"domain":{"id":"4","name":"TV Episodes","description":"Television show episodes"},"entity":{"id":"10055782477","name":"The Herd with Colin Cowherd"}},{"domain":{"id":"11","name":"Sport","description":"Types of sports, like soccer and basketball"},"entity":{"id":"706083902411055104","name":"Basketball"}},{"domain":{"id":"26","name":"Sports League","description":""},"entity":{"id":"706083889454813185","name":"NBA"}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"10","name":"Person","description":"Named people in the world like Nelson Mandela"},"entity":{"id":"890946046343303177","name":"Colin Cowherd","description":"Colin Cowherd"}},{"domain":{"id":"45","name":"Brand Vertical","description":"Top level entities that describe a Brands industry"},"entity":{"id":"781974597310615553","name":"Entertainment"}},{"domain":{"id":"46","name":"Brand Category","description":"Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"},"entity":{"id":"781974597491040257","name":"Sports"}},{"domain":{"id":"47","name":"Brand","description":"Brands and Companies"},"entity":{"id":"10042758024","name":"NBA"}},{"domain":{"id":"60","name":"Athlete","description":"An athlete in the world, like Serena Williams or Lionel Messi"},"entity":{"id":"809849114275893248","name":"Giannis Antetokounmpo"}},{"domain":{"id":"92","name":"Sports Personality","description":"A Sports Personality like 'Skip Bayless'"},"entity":{"id":"890946046343303177","name":"Colin Cowherd","description":"Colin Cowherd"}}],"in_reply_to_user_id":"52529896","created_at":"2019-03-08T19:35:30.000Z","attachments":{"media_keys":{}},"Player":"Giannis_An34","DateTime":"2019-03-09 21:00:00","GameId":"201903090MIL"},{"author_id":"357601180","public_metrics":{"retweet_count":0,"reply_count":1,"like_count":0,"quote_count":0},"referenced_tweets":[{"type":"replied_to","id":"1104075806270210048"}],"id":"1104102442403278849","possibly_sensitive":false,"entities":{"mentions":[{"start":0,"end":9,"username":"RealMarr"},{"start":10,"end":19,"username":"FTFonFS1"},{"start":20,"end":36,"username":"Chris_Broussard"},{"start":37,"end":50,"username":"Giannis_An34"}],"annotations":[{"start":96,"end":100,"probability":0.8051,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"Embid"},{"start":106,"end":109,"probability":0.9028,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"luka"},{"start":159,"end":161,"probability":0.9675,"type":"Organization","normalized_text":"NBA"},{"start":242,"end":245,"probability":0.7458,"type":"Person","normalized_text":"luka"}],"hashtags":{},"urls":{}},"geo":{"coordinates":{"coordinates":{}}},"source":"Twitter for Android","conversation_id":"1104044936855502850","lang":"en","text":"@RealMarr @FTFonFS1 @Chris_Broussard @Giannis_An34 The fact that they are saying a a few years.
